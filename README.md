# SVG Designer

This was a research and experimentation project geared towards using web components for full applications. I chose [haunted](https://github.com/matthewp/haunted) to ease the development process via its React-like hooks that integrate easily with web component architecture. I used lit-html to allow JSX-like syntax with both HTML templates and SVG templates (CSS has to be done inside the HTML template with haunted 🤷‍♀️)

This is bundled with [pikapkg](https://pika.dev). This makes it much easier to natively use ESM and avoid complicated setups when I'm only using modern native JavaScript features (no JSX or need to support IE11).

This project was research for an article I'm writing on [my blog](https://chrisbrownie.dev)! Check back soon to see the article, for now you might check out the other articles I've written 👍.
